 Q: Why do you require me to sign up?
A: Signing up is what allows us to track which plugins are yours, and allows
you to edit them right in your page.

 Q: Will my users see the settings icon in the corner of the Countdown Timer?

    To temporarily hide it, click on your page and then type 'p + down arrow'

typing 'p + up-arrow'.

plugins!
